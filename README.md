# Projects

- **Data-Structure Implementations**: Demonstrates proficiency in Java, algorithm optimization, and data structure design. Includes AVL Tree Implementation focusing on efficient data manipulation and tree balancing techniques, and Fibonacci Heap focused on integer elements, implementing critical operations for optimal performance.
- **In-Context Learning Study**: Investigates the impact of In-Context Learning (ICL) on the performance of two Large Language Models (LLMs), GPT-3.5- turbo and Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, in the domain of question answering. Utilizing the "StrategyQA" dataset, me and my teammates explored how the models‚Äô performance and running time correlate with different numbers of source documents.
- **Implementing Models in NLP Using Python**: 
  - Deep Averaging Networks (DAN) for sentiment analysis on the IMDB dataset, following methodologies outlined in a section of an article. Included plots showcase accuracy as a function of the number of training epochs, the model's accuracy across different dropout rates, accuracy as influenced by the number of hidden layers, and accuracy variations across epochs for different activation functions.
  - TFIDF  a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word within a document in relation to a collection (corpus) of documents. I demonstrated the model's application by using it to sift through Wikipedia content and locate answers to a posed question.
- **ML Assignments and Implementations**: Showcases knowledge gained through various machine learning assignments and implementations, reinforcing understanding and application of ML concepts.
- **Spectral-Clustering using C and python**:This project encompasses the development of an API designed to facilitate spectral clustering operations, showcasing my ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques. By leveraging the eigenvalues of similarity matrices for dimensionality reduction and clustering, the API provides a powerful tool for uncovering the natural grouping of data. This project highlights my skills in machine learning, algorithm implementation, and API design, demonstrating a sophisticated understanding of data-driven problem-solving.
- **Starfleet Java Application**: A sophisticated Java application that simulates the management of a Starfleet, including various types of spacecraft and crew members. This project demonstrates my proficiency in object-oriented programming, leveraging Java's polymorphism, inheritance, and interface-based design to create a detailed simulation that includes spacecraft classification, crew management, and operations. It highlights my ability to design and implement complex systems with clear object-oriented principles and Java programming.
